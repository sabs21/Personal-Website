Nantucket was just a ferry ride away, so one time we decided to visit and roam around the island. After a day of art gallaries, traversing the small windy roads, and endulging in lobster, we were walking back to the ferry to head back to Hyannis when I saw this gorgeous sunset over the docks. This sunset is forever locked in my mind, one which takes me back to Nantucket and high school in general whenever I think of it. As for what I used to make this, I used Three.JS and used glsl/webgl to create shaders for the hurricane lantern. This scene was originally going to be the homepage for my website, but I decided to go this route instead."

The backend of the crawler and search capabilities were built using PHP and a MySQL database while the front end was built using HTML/CSS/Javascript. The crawler detects paragraphs and relates each paragraph to its respective header text, then stores what it finds into the database. Also, the crawler makes note of every single word it comes across and how many times it gets repeated in a page. This is done to guage how related a certain page is to the search query in a simple way and also doubles as a way to spell check the user without the need of a dictionary. The search functionality will also generate suggestions based off of previously searched searches made by other users. This search engine was built to crawl and work with Duda built websites only and I am the sole developer of the engine."
